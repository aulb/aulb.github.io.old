Eating good food is fun.
I thought it'll be fun to catalogue all of the places I've been eating at the past couple years.
Jogging down the memory lane is something I find really relaxing.

What do I hope to achieve from this?


How can I do it?
I decided to open a Yelp account and begin dumping my memory as reviews.
The reason as to why I chose to document on Yelp

(as opposed to simply pin-ing places on Google maps list) is to share my experiences and tips and tricks that I learned for some of my fave eateries.

Also it'll be nice to generate some statistics as to which area in Toronto I ate the most, average food prices, and categories.

I was hoping to be able to simply query to their endpoint and get all of my reviews.
Much to my surprise, Yelp **DOES NOT OFFER** a clean way to scrape user or business reviews.
It does however, offer a way to search for business.

Time for a plan b.




Would I continue this again?
Probably not, its too time consuming to manually update places I've been to.
